The UR-OS simulator is a Java-based application that plans to include all the main active elements of a computer system, to replicate the behavior of an operating system and its relationship with hardware elements like the processor, memory, file system, etc. It presents a modular design that allows the selection of different combinations of algorithms for each function. The current version, 0.0.4.5, is focused on the process planning function and memory management. 

This version implements the FCFS Process Planning algorithm, the Contiguous Memory Allocation algorithm and tne First Fit Free Memory Management algorithm to serve as examples for students, which can be required to implement the rest of the algorithms. In addition, the implementation of the performance indicators for process planning are not included. 

All faculty and researchers interested in accessing the full code can request access via email (pedro.wightman@urosario.edu.co) and any application with the code must give credit for authorship.

This simulator was created by Pedro Wightman, associate professor of the School of Engineering, Science and Technology at Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, Colombia.

This program is a Netbeans 20 project compiled with Java SE 20. The project does not use external libraries apart from the JSE SDK package.
